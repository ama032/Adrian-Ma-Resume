        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration-Financeüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Adrian Ma and I am currently a sophomore year Pre-Business student looking to get into the UCR school of business in order to read Finance. I believe my strongest qualities are in reliability, open-mindedness and flexibility. I believe that part of being reliable is to abide by the code that ‚Äúactions speak louder than words‚Äù because only saying that you will finish what you are meant to do and postponing your work is how things never get done. Being an open-minded and adaptable individual in a world of free voices are key qualities that allow such a person to effectively and efficiently work as a team. While it is important to me to be reliable, there will always be slackers within the team or maybe people who are just struggling with the work. It is important to pick up your team mate‚Äôs slack as ‚Äúa chain is no stronger than its weakest link.‚Äù<br><br>

        I am a native born and raised in Hong Kong who went to boarding school in the UK between ages 13 to 18, and has moved to California ever since to pursue my passion in Finance. I believe that my fortunate experiences of being able to live in three different countries for extended periods of time has allowed me to efficiently communicate with individuals from all walks of life. Thus, my vice presidency within the Cultural Awareness society. In the UK, people tend to be a little more ethnocentric and my duty was to challenge students of this ethnocentrism. Therefore, our team organized talks and lectures that shared knowledge of professors interested in cultural anthropology and international student‚Äôs personal experience to do so. Part of being a society is the activism that comes with it. We coordinated weekly meetings between committee members to discuss deadlines and set weekly objective goals on strategies to raise maximum awareness. One of the projects involved coordinating cooking workshops introducing cuisines from around the world in addition to providing information and history of dishes through pamphlets made with Microsoft Word.<br><br>

        One of my favourite things to do when I was young was playing video games with my older brother. I cannot thank him enough for my average super smash brothers skills as we battled each other on melee. I was obsessed with Pokemon when I was young. Having collected a plethora of trading cards, and played more than ten versions of the Pokemon adventure games, I am proud to say that Pokemon was a big part of my childhood. Mushiking was also a Japanese beetle game that was part of my childhood. I grew up fairly sporty too having played tennis and swam competitively when I was younger. In addition, I still ski and snowboard till this day.
